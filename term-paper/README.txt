Title: Scope of On-Demand Public Transit in Rural Area

Abstract: Transportation is one of the major source of green house gas emission which causes the global warming. Per capita emission is highest in transportation sector in the North America because of very low transit ridership. Low population density specially in rural area causes very little to none public transit infrastructure in here. This problem can be eliminate by using on demand public transit system where riders can request ride in the app and the app will connect the person who can share the ride. The transit driver will choose the most optimum time and most optimum route to serve the maximum rider at a time.
